# Gander

Come and take a gander at my little, hobby web-browser.  Do not expect it to develop with any degree of haste, but I intend it to be minimally complex and maximally customizable.

The plan is to write the "skeleton" of the browser, the part that does the networking, visuals &c., in C and everything else in LUA.  The JavaScript interpreter e.g. shall be written in LUA.
